            <div itemprop="articleBody"><h2 id="Preface"><a href="#Preface" class="headerlink" title="Preface"></a>Preface</h2><p>Earlier this year, Slovakia won the bid of the host nation of the 2025 U21 European Championships (‘U21 Euro’).</p>
<p>Slovak fans have fond memories of the last U21 Euro with Slovak participant in 2017. The backbone of that team, Milan Škriniar and Stanislav Lobotka, have now led the senior national team to a spot at Euro 2024. Many members of the senior national team today also played in that tournament: Ľubomír Šatka, Martin Valjent, Matúš Bero, Albert Rusnák, Denis Vavro, Lukáš Haraslín, László Bénes… As the sun sets on the remaining members of the South African generation, we continue to wonder who will take over the baton from Kucka and Pekarík, and if there will be new surprises.</p>
<p>We can consider Slovak players born in 2002-2005, especially 2003-2005, very lucky. They have already participated in the U19 Euro in 2022, of which Slovakia was also the host. Then they qualified for the 2023 U20 World Cup in Argentina. While previous generations had to fight hard in qualification, they have gained such experience on a biggehr stage with relative ease. However, although the team has certain level of talent, the performances in these tournaments were less than satisfactory. </p>
<p>The burden on the shoulders of Jaroslav Kentoš is therefore high. His team fell to Ukraine in the qualification playoffs for U21 Euro 2023, notably collapsed in the 2nd half of the 2nd leg and lost 0-3, after claiming a 3-2 victory in the first leg at home.</p>
<p>As the qualification of U21 Euro 2025 is still going on, we don’t know Slovakia U21’s opponents yet. However, going through the preparation games so far may offer us a peek at the team, its core players and its style, which can be indicative to the main tournament. </p>
<h2 id="Preparations-before-MS20"><a href="#Preparations-before-MS20" class="headerlink" title="Preparations before MS20"></a>Preparations before MS20</h2><p>The U21 national team played 10 international games in 2023 (the training match against Dukla Banská Bystrica in October behind closed doors not included). 5 in spring and summer, and 5 more since September. As the U20 national team had to prepare for MS20, the best players born in 2003-05, many turn out to be important players for this U21 team, were not available to Kentoš. </p>
<p>Perhaps as a result of this, it would be an overstatement to say that the team did well in those 5 games. In March they participated in a mini-tournament in Turkey, drawing Slovenia 0-0 and beating Bulgaria and North Macedonia by 1-0. Then the two games in June ended a 1-1 draw against Austria and a 0-1 loss to Hungary. </p>

<h2 id="Love-your-neighbour"><a href="#Love-your-neighbour" class="headerlink" title="Love your neighbour"></a>Love your neighbour</h2><p>We shall consider September 2023 as the official start of the preparation for the U21 Euro. And who is a better first opponent to test their strength than our western neighbour? In fact, Slovakia U21 has player Czech U21 twice this past autumn.</p>
<p>Belko and Kaprílik were joined by Kóša, M. Sauer, Gajdoš (Jambor was injured in September), and even younger prodigies L. Sauer and Marcelli, and thanks to these additions, Kentoš’s team could carry out more sophisticated game plans with better chemistry and cohesion. Slovakia U21’s first half in Uherské Hradiště was impressive, as they made full use of their technical defenders and midfielders to perform quick passes and combinations, while effectively strangled the Czechs by pressing. The Czechs employed a strange 3421 formation which did not work.</p>
<p>We will use the following plots throughout this article. Expected goals (xG) is a measure of chance created, and (opponent) passes allowed per defensive action (PPDA) is a measure of pressing intensity. The higher the team’s PPDA is, the more intensive the pressing is. </p>
<p>We can see that in the first half, our PPDA was much higher, and at times our opponents struggled to create chances. However, we were not great at creating scoring chances either, even though Leo Sauer and Kaprálik did well to create some space. </p>
<p>Then in the second half, we started to realize that their stronger players like Fila and Tkáč did not play in the first half. As they entered the pitch, they quickly turned the tide with the skills of these key players, and the game ended 0-2 for us.</p>
<h2 id="Danish-and-Polish-lessons"><a href="#Danish-and-Polish-lessons" class="headerlink" title="Danish and Polish lessons"></a>Danish and Polish lessons</h2><p>The away game in Vejle against Denmark cannot be an easy one. If Slovakia U21 yearns for more speed and pressing, then Denmark can be a good teacher. The game saw Denmark dominating every category of statistics except for goals scored. It almost felt like a senior national team game in Kozák’s or Tarkovič’s era as we spent a lot of time defending. Thanks to the effort from Ľubomír Belko though, we did not conceed a single goal and earned enough time for Leo Sauer and Kaprálik to came on while the Danes got tired. Again, in a rather Kozák-esque fashion, we scored two goals from counterattack. It was by no means a stellar performance except for Belko, but the victory proved to be valuable. </p>
<p>The game against Poland in October was quite open (not because the stands in Košice are not completed yet) with both teams scored quick goals. Aftrwards, while we tried to apply a constant pressure, the Poles applied intermittently very high pressure. </p>
<h2 id="To-press-or-not-to-press"><a href="#To-press-or-not-to-press" class="headerlink" title="To press or not to press?"></a>To press or not to press?</h2><p>In my opinion, the best game in the preparation period is not the win against Denmark, but the 2-2 home draw against Croatia. As Leo Sauer was called up by Calzona to enjoy aome time on the bench in the senior national team, his teammates in U21 put up a great team effort. They applied huge pressure onto the Croatians, forcing turnovers in their own half, or direct and inaccurate long passes to their striker. </p>
<p>While transitioning to defence, Slovakia U21 often employs a 5-2 structure where 4 defenders plus Kaprálik quickly drop back and block the middle, and 2 midfielders follow. This is effective in blocking potential passing lanes and proves to be effective in protecting players like Šikula (who is not good at 1v1 on ME19 and MS20). After winning the ball back, Mário Sauer and others can quickly distribute the ball to dashing forwards or wingbacks for a counterattack. The striker on paper, Timotej Jambor, also has decent speed and can play as a makeshift winger in these situations. Jambor did not get a lot of scoring chances here, but he was helped by Nebyla and Kaprálik each scored in the first half, and Javorček and Leitner also hit the woodwork. </p>
<p>Notably, the Croatians were missing several key players in this age category, such as Martin Baturina, Luka Sušić, Roko Šimić, Dion Drena Beljo… as they were called up to their senior national team. Oh yes, and also Joško Gvardiol. But their individual skills are still impressive, especially when Slovak players are tired, and defenders were forced into more 1v1 situations. The penalty, through which Croatia levelled the game 2-2, occurred when Šikula was dribbled past, which was perhaps his first and only mistake in the game. </p>
<p>Similar situation occurred a few days later in Hradec Kralove where we played the Czechs for a second time in 2023. While many of our tired players got a rest, the Czechs fielded a strong lineup and went back to a more traditional 4231&#x2F;433, with a focus on combinations on the wings and physicality. After learning the lesson in September, they played the same trick against us by pressing Slovakia first. The mismatch was evident as the Czechs had multiple chances from set pieces and scored an early goal. Although a wonder goal in the 22th minute from Artur Gajdoš levelled the game, at half time the expected goal was 0.1-1.14 in favour of the Czechs. After half-time, there was another goal from Kabongo, who plays in our league. Kentos admitted after the game that the team had problem against the opponent’s physicality.</p>
<p>Another main factor affecting our defence is that the full backs can no longer attack deeper into the opposite half due to the heavy defence work. Thus in the 75th minute in Hradec Kralove, Kentos made an important move by switching from 433 to 343. While many think 343 might be more defensive, Javorček and Šikula have more freedom to move forward and attack, and created a few dangerous attacks. Of course, we probably cannot ignore the fact that after the 75th minutes, the Czechs might lost their interest in this game. But still, this is the first time Kentoš changes to 343 and tries to mimic the MŠK Žilina system which has been quite effective in the Niké League this season.</p>
<h2 id="General-style-and-looking-forward"><a href="#General-style-and-looking-forward" class="headerlink" title="General style and looking forward"></a>General style and looking forward</h2><p>Whether Kentoš is trying to replicate the current or former MŠK Žilina style, or create his own style, we are certain that his team has a great emphasis on speed in transition and pressing. We already talked about their high pressing and the “4-2 (or 5-2)” structure in defence based on my observations, so let’s talk more about the attack. It is a very vertical styled football, and players like Kaprálik seem to be developed specifically for this purpose. Meanwhile, Mário Sauer, Tomáš Rigo and some defenders on this team are experts in delivering long passes. This team builds up attack around wingers and attacking wingbacks, and their attack can be very dangerous if the wingbacks can attack deep into opponent half. Though if they can’t due to heavy defensive duties, switching to 343 might be necessary.</p>
<p>However, no strategy is invincible or universal. One of the main weaknesses of this team is that the players don’t do well physical battles, perhaps due to the over-emphasis on speed and techniques in their development. For example, in the Niké league, Mário Sauer has a duel success rate of 55.3%, while in this year’s U21 games his success rate is only 36.9%.</p>
<p>It is noticeable that this strategy is physically demanding due to the high amount of running required, and is best carried out by a group of core players. Once their stamina is drained, Kentos will face a dilemma. While tired players should be brought off and having five substitutions can also help, some players on the bench may not carry out the tactics as effectively, and team performance could deteriorate. This is, in principle, why we could not hold on to the 2-1 lead against Croatia, or why we dont perform well with a rotated squad. </p>
<p>Of course, we have also never faced the strongest teams in Europe during the preparation phase yet, so we dont know if this strategy will still be effective against them.</p>
<p>As I said, some core players probably have had their spot booked for the final tournament in 2025 already, such as Belko, Javorček, Obert, Leitner, Mário Sauer, Rigo, Nebyla, Kaprálik and Jambor. Sebastián Kóša, Leo Sauer and Nino Marcelli might not be far off either.</p>
<p>In the main tournament, there might be no room for any rotation, while we have to play 3 games within a week, so stamina and regeneration of certain players may become a problem. If we cannot seal the win and close out the game early, it might become a huge pitfall. Therefore, looking for suitable players on the bench, as well as an effective plan B, is paramount for Kentoš. We hope he can find some solutions to these problems, and meanwhile keeps the current strategy going. </p>
